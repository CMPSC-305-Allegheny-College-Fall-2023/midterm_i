# Midterm Exam for Database Systems

## Name: Add Your Name Here

## Due: Before 4:20PM on 9 November 2023

Please note that at 4:20PM on 9 November 2023 you will lose `write` access to your exam repository and will no longer be able to commit and push to it. Please make sure all of your work has been submitted before the lab ends at 4:20PM.

## Data

The data, "Students Performance in Exams" was taken from Kaggle at the reference: [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/spscientist/students-performance-in-exams/](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/spscientist/students-performance-in-exams/).

This data concerns test scores in *Math*, *Reading* and *Writing* by school students in light of the types of lunches that they typically eat at school: *standard* and *free/reduced*. The level of education completed by the students' parents is also included in the data set: *bachelor's degree*, *some college*, *master's degree*, *associate's degree*, *high school*, *some high school*.

## Instructions

Please address the questions below by completing the suggested number of queries to gain proper insight into the actual response to the bulleted question. You will have to construct each query and run it using the database that you built from the supplied data. Then, you will have to consider the results of your queries in order to provide an informed response to questions.

Where necessary, please write in a **clear and meaningful** language (no one-liners, please) as you leave your responses.

### Q2

For each class (i.e., "Group A", "Group B", and "Group C"), determine the number of females who were involved in the study and had an average score (between *Math*, *Reading* and *Writing*) of at least 70 (passing). (Three queries to create.)

Answer: TODO

* Imagine that you are a school superintendent who has been tasked to study passing rates at the school where the data was taken. Using insight from the above queries concerning groups and average scores (in *Math*, *Reading* and *Writing*), prepare an argument (a short paragraph) to suggest that the school is performing well or not well enough, in terms of passing its students in *math*, *reading* and *writing*. 
Note: such little data from this study is unlikely to be enough for such an assessment. However, please try your best using the knowledge from above.
